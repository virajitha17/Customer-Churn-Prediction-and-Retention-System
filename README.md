Hello! 
I have done this using Kaggle dataset (soumilmukhopadhyay/xyz-bank-customer-churn). 
- this predicts the chance each customer will churn
- Segments them into “High Risk” or “Low Risk”
- Recommends personalized retention strategies (like discounts or engagement).
  
The output you will see will be something like this:
 RowNumber  CreditScore       Age  ...  ChurnProbability    Segment                           Strategy
0  -1.731618    -0.319704 -0.059275  ...              0.68  High Risk  Offer Discount or Loyalty Program
1  -1.730751    -0.432656 -0.153866  ...              0.17   Low Risk                 Regular Engagement
2  -1.729885    -1.521098 -0.059275  ...              0.80  High Risk  Offer Discount or Loyalty Program

Sorry there was an issue for creating a new git profile with my college mail id, so I did this in my own personal git profile. Hope you understand!
